<p class="drop-cap2">AT the close of the war and after their discharge the
members of the 21st Missouri Regiment scattered
over Missouri and other States of the Union. No
effort was made to keep the organization alive until 1888,
when T. W. Holman, responding to the whisperings of
memory for a sight and hand clasp of the old comrades of
&#8217;61-&#8217;66, on his own responsibility published a call, in
August, 1888, for a meeting of the survivors at Arbela,
Mo. The result was a large gathering of the veterans
and the organization of the 21st Missouri Infantry Veteran
Volunteers Association. From that date to the present
time annual meetings have been held. At the meeting in
1896, Messrs. T. W. Holman and N. D. Starr were made
Regimental Historians, to compile and perpetuate the
history of the regiment. At the next meeting, in 1897,
these comrades made a partial report, and at the Edina,
Mo., meeting in 1898, submitted the result of their labors
in manuscript form. A motion was then made and carried
that T. W. Holman continue the labor and revise and
prepare the manuscript for publication and have it printed
for the use of the Association. In accordance with the
foregoing instructions the succeeding pages are respectfully
submitted.</p>

<blockquote>
<div class="hangingindent">
<p>Organization of the 1st and 2d North Missouri Regiments,
June and July, 1861.&mdash;Campaigning in North Missouri
During the Summer of 1861.&mdash;Order Consolidating the
1st and 2d North Missouri Regiments, Thereafter
Known as the 21st Regiment, Missouri Infantry Vols.</p></div></blockquote>


<p class="drop-cap2">AFTER the election of Abraham Lincoln in 1860 many
political disturbances and difficulties arose and he
was inaugurated during a time of overwhelming
excitement. The government of Missouri at that time
was in the hands of those who were clamoring for secession
from the Union of States. Claiborne F. Jackson, who
had been trained in the political school of &#8220;States Rights,&#8221;
was elected Governor. Early in the spring of 1861 Camp
Jackson was established in St. Louis and troops for State
service were mustered at that point.</p>

<p>The Southern states, one after another, withdrew from
the Union and on April the 11th, 1861, Fort Sumter was
fired on by the Confederates. This was the bugle call to
arms, and President Lincoln&#8217;s proclamation for 75,000 men
to serve for ninety days followed. Frank P. Blair, afterwards
Major General, received authority from the general
government to organize and muster into service troops for
the prosecution of the war for the preservation of the
Union.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span>The muster of troops for the state was very irregular
and was the cause afterwards of considerable confusion.
Some men were enlisted for the war, some for one year,
then for three years; some to serve in the state only, while
others were enlisted for service in the northern part of the
state and others for the southern part. The army thus
organized was one of questionable authority. The Governor
maintained that the general government had no
right to invade the state, and the latter hesitated in regard
to sending troops into a state not in open revolt against
the government.</p>

<p>During this period of hesitation and confusion Col. D.
Moore was commissioned Colonel and received authority
to enlist and organize the 1st North Missouri Volunteers;
and Col. H. M. Woodyard was given like authority to
organize the 2d North Missouri Volunteers. In the summer
and fall of 1861 these troops, acting separately, held
North Missouri against the Confederates under Cols. Porter
and Green. The anomalous conditions then existing in
the state are explained by the position of the Confederates,
who claimed that they were resisting armed invasion of the
State by the Federal Government.</p>


<h3>THE FIRST NOTE OF DEFIANCE.</h3>

<p>About May 30, 1861, Col. Moore received authority
from Gen. Lyons to raise a regiment for the Federal service,
taking the field at the head of ten men. Clear and
ringing as a bugle blast he sounded the following challenge,
which was posted in hand bills over Northeast
Missouri and Southern Iowa:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>The undersigned is authorized to raise a company of
volunteers in the county, for the Union service. All who
are willing to fight for their homes, their country and the
flag of the glorious Union, are invited to join him, bringing
with them their arms and ammunition. Until the
Government can aid us we must take care of ourselves.
Secessionists and rebel traitors desiring a fight can be
accommodated on demand.</p>

<p class="right"><span class="smcap">D. Moore.</span></p></blockquote>

<p>(The above is a verbatim copy.&mdash;T. W. H.)</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span>Cols. Moore and Woodyard, with their commands, were
so continuously engaged with the enemy either in skirmishing,
scouting or fighting, that no time was left them
for looking after recruits. Hence when the time came to
be regularly received into service both regiments were
short of the requisite number of men. Consequently the
two regiments were consolidated into what is known as
the 21st Regiment of Missouri Volunteers, by the following
order:</p>

<p>SPECIAL ORDERS, NO. 15.</p>



<p>1st. The battalion of Missouri Volunteers heretofore
known as 1st North Missouri Regiment, under the command
of Col. D. Moore, and the battalion of Missouri Volunteers
heretofore known as the 2d North Missouri Regiment,
under the command of Col. H. M. Woodyard, are

<p>As a result of the above order the two regiments were
consolidated on the 1st day of February, 1862, and were
mustered into the service of the United States by Lieut.
Col. Fetterman, as the 21st Missouri Infantry Volunteers,

<p>It was in Canton where the regiment was mustered into
service and about the 15th of February it left that place
and marched by way of LaGrange and Palmyra to Hannibal,
Mo., where several weeks were spent in training in
military duties. On the 28th of March orders came to go
to the front. Camp equipments were soon packed and the
regiment on the way to St. Louis. After a brief stop there
it was taken by boat to Savannah, Tennessee. This<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span>
place was General Grant&#8217;s headquarters, who was then
making the plans which resulted in the fall of Corinth.
The regiment reported to Gen. Grant and was sent immediately
to the front and assigned to the 1st Brigade, 6th
Division, Army of West Tennessee, under command of
Gen. B. M. Prentiss.</p>

<p>The men were soon to see fighting in earnest now.
They were on the ground where the memorable battle of
Shiloh was fought a few days after their arrival, to-wit:
the 6th and 7th of April, 1862, and on account of their
advanced position they were the first to become engaged
with the enemy. The regiment suffered heavily in the
fight, losing one officer and thirty men killed, with four
officers and one hundred and fifty men wounded. Three
officers and sixty-eight men were also taken prisoners. It
was here that the gallant Maj. King fell mortally wounded.
The reports of the battle by Cols. Moore and Woodyard,
published here, give a full account of the part taken by
the regiment:</p>

<p>SIR:&mdash;In pursuance of the order of Brig. Gen. B. M.
Prentiss, commanding 6th Division, Army of West Tennessee,
I, on Saturday, (April 5th,) proceeded to a reconnoisance
on the front of the line of Gen. Prentiss&#8217; division,
and on the front of Gen. Sherman&#8217;s division. My command
consisted of three companies from the 21st Missouri
Regiment, companies commanded by Capt&#8217;s Cox, Harle
and Pearce. A thorough reconnoisance over the extent of
three miles failed to discover the enemy. Being unsuccessful,
as stated, I returned to my encampment about 7
p. m. On Sunday morning, the 6th inst., at about 6
o&#8217;clock, being notified that the picket guard of the 1st
Brigade, 6th Division, had been attacked and driven in, by
order of Col. Everett Peabody, commanding the 1st Brigade,
6th Division, I advanced with five companies of my
command a short distance from the outer line of our encampment.
I met the retreating pickets of the 1st Brigade
bringing in their wounded. Those who were able for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span>
duty were ordered and compelled to return to their posts,
and learning that the enemy were advancing in force I advanced
with the remaining companies of my regiment,
which companies having joined me I ordered an advance
and attacked the enemy, who was commanded by Brig.
Gen. Ruggles, of the Rebel army. A terrific fire was
opened upon us from the whole front of the four or five
regiments forming the advance of the enemy, which my
gallant soldiers withstood during thirty minutes, until I
had communicated the intelligence of the movement
against us to my commanding General. About this time,
being myself severely wounded, the bone of the leg below
my knee being shattered, I was compelled to retire from
the field, leaving Lieut. Col. Woodyard in command.</p>

<p>SIR:&mdash;I have the honor to report that on the morning
of the 6th of April, before sunrise, Gen. Prentiss ordered
Col. Moore, with five companies of our regiment, to sustain
the pickets of the 12th Michigan Infantry. The Col.
had not proceeded more than half a mile when he met the
pickets coming in with many killed and wounded. Col.
Moore immediately dispatched Lieut. Menn for the remaining
five companies. Gen. Prentiss being in camp,
ordered me to join Col. Moore. We marched some three
hundred yards together, after I formed the junction, in a
nearly westerly direction, flank movement, four ranks,
when the head of the column came to the northwest corner
(this should have been the northeast corner.&mdash;T. W. H.)
of a cotton field. We were here fired upon and Col.
Moore received a severe wound in the right leg, and Lieut.
Menn was wounded in the head. I then assumed command
of the regiment and formed a line of battle on the
brow of a hill, on the cotton field, facing nearly west. I
held this position for some half or three-quarters of an hour
and kept the enemy in check. He fell back and endeavored
to outflank me. Discovering this I moved my line
to the north of the field again. I was then joined by four
companies of the 16th Wisconsin Infantry. Having no
field officers with them I ordered them to a position east of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span>
the field, and as soon as this was done joined them with
my command. This line of battle was formed facing
south, behind a small incline, enabling my men to load
and be out of range of the enemy&#8217;s fire. The position
proved a strong one and we managed to hold it for upward
of an hour. Finding they could not dislodge us the enemy
again tried to outflank us and deal a cross fire. I then fell
back in good order, firing as we did so, to the next hill.
Col. Peabody, commanding the 1st Brigade, here came up
with the 25th Missouri Regiment. I requested him to
bring his men up to the hill on our right, as it would
afford protection to his men and be of assistance to my
command. He did so, but the enemy coming by heavy
main center and dealing a heavy cross-fire from our right
and left, we could not maintain this position for over thirty
minutes. We gradually began to fall back and reached
our tents, when the ranks got broken in passing through
them. We endeavored to rally our men in the rear of our
tents and formed as well as could be expected, but my men
got much scattered, a great many falling into other regiments,
under the immediate command of Gen. Prentiss.
Others divided to other divisions but continued to fight
during the two days.</p>

<p>Falling back to the second hill, Maj. Barnabas B. King
received a mortal wound and died in about thirty minutes.
He rendered me great assistance in the action, cheering on
and encouraging my men. His death is a heavy loss to
us. He was ever active, energetic and at his post of duty,
vigilant in attending to the wants of the men. Adjt. C.
C. Tobin, who is now missing, also proved himself very
active on the field. He is supposed to be a prisoner and
taken at the same time with Gen. Prentiss. I cannot too
highly praise the conduct of the officers and men of my
command, and of the companies of the 16th Wisconsin,
who acted in concert with me.</p>

<p>To go back to the battle of Shiloh:</p>

<p>It was here that Gen. Prentiss was captured and Gen.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span>
Peabody killed. The 21st, after losing Gen. Prentiss, was
under the command of his successor, Gen. McKean, who
then directed the movements of the 6th Division. The
1st Brigade of the 6th, to which the 21st was attached, was
commanded, after Gen. Peabody, by Gen. McArthur.</p>

<p>The gallant 21st had no time to rest and recuperate after
its severe fight at Shiloh. Under Gen. Halleck, who succeeded
Gen. Grant after the Shiloh engagement, the regiment
took an active part in the siege of Corinth. On the
30th of April began the march on this formidable Confederate
stronghold. It was fighting, advancing and building
breastworks, until the enemy finally evacuated the town
and our victorious soldiers entered, on the 29th day of
May, 1862.</p>

<p>The regiment laid around Corinth until about June 10th,
when it was taken to Chewalla, Tennessee, about ten miles
away, on the Memphis &amp; Charleston R. R. Here they did
light guard duty and enjoyed a well deserved rest until
August 30th. The country was picturesque and beautiful
and abounded in fruits of all kinds; but even here the 21st
had its troubles and trials. Small pox broke out in the
camp. More than seventy cases were on hand at one time&mdash;and
those not afflicted or doing guard duty had to take
their turns at nursing their comrades. But the malady
finally run its course, after leaving a death list of thirty-odd
men. On leaving Chewalla, the regiment returned
to Corinth and was ordered, on September 10th, to Kossuth,
Mississippi, for outpost duty; but in a few days was
ordered back to Corinth, reaching there on the morning of
the 3d of October.</p>

<p>The regiment had just got settled in its tents, on the
morning of the 3d of October, on its return from Kossuth,
when the bugle call to arms summoned the men to
rush out and fall into line of battle. The battle of Corinth
began about daylight, and the men of the 21st were in the
midst of it. The report of Col. Moore, here published,
shows the part the 21st took in the engagement:</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Captain</span>:&mdash;I have the honor to report the part taken by
the 21st Mo. Vols, in the engagement before Corinth, Miss.,
October 3 and 4, 1862. On the afternoon of Oct. 2, 1862,
I was relieved from outpost duty and command of the post
of Kossuth, Miss., by Col. Smith, 43d Ohio. We returned
to our camp at Corinth, Miss., the same night, arriving at
3 o&#8217;clock a. m. About 4:30 a. m. we heard artillery fire
some distance to the front; the battalion was formed
promptly in line, and shortly after we were directed to
take position upon the Memphis &amp; Charleston R. R., in
support of battery E; here we remained until 9 a. m., when
we were ordered to march two miles to the front and take
position upon a high ridge to the left of the Memphis &amp;
Charleston R. R., and upon the extreme left of the line of
battle, continuously with the 16th Wisconsin Vols., of the
6th Division, and two regiments of Gen. Davie&#8217;s Division,
who were stationed immediately to the right of the railroad.
We had been in position but a few minutes when
the enemy opened fire on our flank and front. We replied
promptly and continued showing the most determined resistance,
the enemy being in so far superior numbers that
we were temporarily driven from the line. About this
time my horse was shot under me, bruising severely my
amputated leg. I here turned the command over to Major
Moore, who, with great gallantry, assisted by the officers
of the regiment, rallied the men and repeatedly drove the
enemy from the hill. The fire to the right became very
severe,&mdash;the regiment stationed there, and battery, gave
way before the masses of the approaching enemies. Seeing
this, and our men being nearly out of cartridges, having
fired forty rounds, the battalion was ordered to fall
back, which was done in good order and firing. It is with
pleasure I notice the bravery of my field staff and line
officers&mdash;they were equal to the emergency. Corporal
Jesse Roberts, Company I, 21st Mo. Inf. Vols., showed
great bravery; he gallantly seized the colors (after Color
Sergeant had fallen back), causing great enthusiasm
among the men. Respectfully, your obedient servant,</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sir</span>:&mdash;I have the honor to report the part taken by the
21st Mo. Vol. Infantry Regiment in the Battle of Corinth,
Miss., on Friday and Saturday, the 3d and 4th of October,
1862. After Col. Moore, commanding the regiment, was
carried off the field, I assumed the command. The men
were going back from their original position. With the
assistance of the line officers I succeeded in rallying the
men, who went boldly forward to the front and drove the
enemy from the position that we occupied at the commencement
of the engagement. As soon as the position
was gained fighting became desperate, our lines being
distant from those of the enemy less than fifty paces. The
command held this ground until the force upon our right,
consisting of artillery and infantry, had given away and
was in full retreat. About this time the enemy was flanking
us on our left and dense columns of infantry pressed
us on our front. I ordered the regiment to retire. In
doing so some of our men got scattered. We succeeded
again in rallying the men, and formed on the flanks of a
line being formed by Brig. Gen. McArthur, to construct a
temporary breastwork of logs, and did so; but before completing
the same we were ordered to a position on the
extreme left in the vicinity of the seminary. We were
engaged with the enemy while in this position. About
2:30 P. M., I was ordered to proceed to Battery C and
report to Brig. Gen. McArthur. Having three companies
of skirmishers in the rear, under his direction we scoured
the woods but found no enemy excepting a few stragglers.
We then took the south bridge road in the direction of
Mr. Alexander&#8217;s, the rebel cavalry fleeing before our
advance. We succeeded in capturing a great number of
prisoners, from one of whom I learned the rebel hospitals
were in the vicinity. It was now dark. I pushed forward
and took possession of all property and persons. A great
many prisoners were taken that night and early next
morning trying to escape through the lines. The total
number captured, including the wounded, amounted to
nearly 900 officers and men. We also captured 460 muskets,
400 cartridge boxes and a quantity of belts, etc.
Under the instructions of Brig. Gen. McArthur I remained<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span>
at the hospitals with the command until Sunday about
noon, when Col. Moore took command of the regiment.
Our loss during the engagement is one killed, seventeen
wounded and six prisoners. I mention with satisfaction
the behavior of the line officers. They used every exertion
to keep their men together and remained with them
during the engagement, thereby setting a good example to
the men to do their duty. During the action a great many
of our guns were useless; after firing fifteen or twenty
rounds of ammunition it was impossible to load them.</p>

<p>I have the honor to be,</p>

<p class="right">Your obedient servant,  <span class="gap"><span class="smcap">Edwin Moore</span>,</span><br />
Maj. 21st Mo. Infantry Vols.</p></blockquote>

<p>At the close of the Corinth engagement the whole number
of the regiment did not exceed 400 men. Over 600
during the period the command had been in active service
had been lost either in battle, sickness or captured by the
enemy. While at Chewalla a detail had been sent home
to muster recruits and a few days after the Corinth fight
the whole regiment, or what was left of it, was furloughed
for thirty days. The men returned home, where they
found recruiting offices had been opened by the detail of
men sent from Chewalla, at Memphis and Edina. North
Missouri was still bubbling over with patriotism for the
Stars and Stripes. The tattered and worn condition of
the 400 survivors of the 21st, with their battle torn flag,
gave a new impetus to the war spirit. Volunteers sprung
up from every side and in an incredibly short while the
regiment was recruited to double its number. Canton
was the rallying point for the men and from that place on
the 10th of December, 1862, tents were folded, good-byes
to loved ones said, and the gallant old 21st once more
started for the bloody theatre of war. The objective
point was Holly Springs, Miss., where the old 6th Division
of the Army of West Tennessee was encamped.</p>

<p>At St. Louis the regiment boarded the steamer known
in history as the Di Vernon, and got as far as Columbus, Ky.,
on December the 20th, where the command was stopped.
Instead of proceeding to Holly Springs, the regiment was
ordered by Gen. Asboth, commander of the Columbus<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span>
Post, to Union City, Tenn., twenty miles from Columbus,
to do outpost duty guarding Gen. Grant&#8217;s line of communication
between Columbus and Corinth, which had been
interrupted by raids of Confederate cavalry under Gen.
Forrest.</p>

<p>Here barracks of logs and stockades were built and the
men camped for the winter, doing guard duty and everything
else incident to a military camp, facing a vigilant
enemy. In this time Gen. Grant had gotten as far as
Milliken&#8217;s Bend, on his way to Vicksburg, and on the first
of March, 1863, the regiment pulled up stakes to join him.
But again the fortunes of war decreed otherwise. Gen.
Forrest, of the Confederacy, had made another raid in the
rear of Gen. Grant, and at Columbus the regiment was
switched off to Clinton, Ky., where for two months it was
engaged again in the same kind of service as at Union
City. On May 11th orders again came to move on towards
Vicksburg. At Columbus the regiment boarded the
steamer J. J. Rowe and started south to join the old 6th
Division operating under Gen. Grant. On May 15th
Memphis was reached and orders were found waiting us to
report to Gen. Hurlburt, Post Commander there. Here the
regiment was kept at garrison duty until about January
25th, 1864. While in garrison at Memphis the 21st was
attached to the 1st Brigade, 3d Division, of the 16th Army
Corps, commanded by Gen. A. J. Smith. The 1st Brigade
was composed of, besides the 21st, the 89th Indiana, 119th
Illinois, 58th Illinois, and the 9th Indiana Battery, commanded
by Col. David Moore. On January the 28th the
command boarded a steamer en route for Vicksburg. On
the way down the river, opposite Islands Nos. 70 and 71,
the vessel was fired on from the shore by Confederates
under Gen. Marmaduke, and three men were killed and
four wounded. With no other incident the regiment
reached Vicksburg on the 1st of February.</p>

<p>On the next day, with the army under Gen. Sherman,
the march to Meridian, Miss., began. They met and
skirmished with the enemy at Champion Hills, on February<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span>
5th, Brandon on February 12th, and Meridian on
February 14th.</p>

<p>From Meridian, Miss., the regiment was sent back to
Vicksburg, returning by the way of Canton, reaching
there on March 4th, where most of the regiment re-enlisted
for three years more, or till the war was ended. At Meridian
and on the trip back our army destroyed some forty
miles of railroad and inflicted other damages on the
enemy.</p>

<p>Returning to Vicksburg the veterans re-enlisting were
granted a thirty days&#8217; furlough. There was a happy
home-coming for these scarred warriors of the 21st, who
had, by their gallant services, well earned their holiday.
But there was quite a number of the 21st, about two
hundred and fifty, who failed to enlist as veterans under
the holiday offer. These were assigned to Gen. Banks&#8217;
army and took part in what is known to history as the
Red River Campaign.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">A Graphic Account of the Campaign
told by T. W. Holman.</span></h3>

<p class="drop-cap2">ABOUT the 5th of March, the regiment having returned
to Vicksburg from the Meridian Campaign, the veterans
were sent home on a thirty days&#8217; furlough.
Those of the regiment who did not re-enlist, about one
hundred, and about one hundred and forty recruits, were
assigned to the 24th Missouri for duty. The 24th Missouri
belonged to Col. Shaw&#8217;s brigade and was designated the
2d Brigade, 3d Division, 16th Corps, and was composed of
the following named regiments: The 14th, 27th and 32d
Iowa, and 24th Missouri, with the detachment of the 21st
Missouri. The 21st Missouri men were consolidated and
made three companies, about eighty men to the company.
There being no commissioned officers with us, Lieuts.
Denny, Yarbrough and Shadel, officers of the 24th, were
assigned to command the three companies of the 21st.</p>


<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span>Gen. Banks having called on Gen. Sherman for ten
thousand men to assist him in the Red River Campaign,
the 1st Division, 17th Corps, Gen. Joe Mower commanding,
and the 3d Division, 16th Corps, Col. R. C. Moore, of
the 117th Illinois, commanding, under Gen. A. J. Smith,
were assigned to this duty, and ordered to report to Gen.
Banks. The expedition left Vicksburg about the 8th of
March, reached the mouth of Red river on the 12th, and
was there met by Admiral Porter with a gun boat fleet.
Under convoy of the same the expedition started up Red
river, reaching Simm&#8217;s Landing, on the Atchafalaya river,
about 5 p. m. Col. Shaw was ordered to disembark his
brigade and picket the road towards Fort De Russy.
March 13th Col. Shaw was ordered to move out on the Fort
De Russy road. He advanced with his brigade along
Bayou Rapides about four miles to Yellow Bayou. Here
he found some earth works and a regiment of Confederate
troops, with two pieces of artillery. On our approach they
at once fell back towards Fort De Russy. We then
returned to the landing. During our absence the balance
of our troops disembarked and went into camp.</p>

<p>On the 14th we had orders to move with two days&#8217;
rations and forty rounds of ammunition, and 7 a. m. found
us on the road with Col. Shaw&#8217;s brigade in the advance,
the 24th and 21st Missouri in front. It was about eighteen
miles across the bend of Red river, where rumor reported
heavy earthworks and forts, and some six thousand Confederate
troops under command of Gen. Walker. The
roads were good and our column moved rapidly, reaching
Fort De Russy about 3 p. m. Col. Shaw&#8217;s brigade went
into line some four hundred yards from the upland fort,
with the 3d Indiana battery in the center. We met a
warm reception from fourteen guns in the upland fort and
from heavy guns in the water battery. We advanced
sharpshooters and our Indiana battery of four guns and
commenced pounding away on the upland fort. By 5 p.
m. our sharpshooters had the guns in the forts silenced, or
at least made it such hazardous work to load and fire that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span>
the guns were only served occasionally. This was the
signal for the assault. About 6 p. m. Gen. Mower ordered
Col. Shaw to charge. His brigade fixed bayonets and with
a yell made a dash for the enemy&#8217;s works. The ground
over which we had to pass was open, the timber having
been used in the construction of the forts and bomb proofs.
In our charge we were supported by the balance of our
division. While charging we received a fringe of musket
fire from the thin line of men inside the fort. In three
minutes we were at the ditches and the garrison, seeing
that further resistance was useless, ran up a white flag.
The 24th and 21st Missouri were the first regiments to
plant their flags on the fort, and in recognition of that fact
and as a reward, we were detailed the guard of honor and
remained in the fort during the night, with our regimental
colors flying on the ramparts.</p>

<p>The fruits of the victory were: in the upland fort, fourteen
guns; in the water battery, three guns, two of them
120 pounders, and one rifle 42, a large amount of ammunition
and quartermaster&#8217;s stores, with three hundred and
fifty prisoners. Commodore Porter, who was on his way
up the river with his gun boat fleet, did not get up in time
to participate in the capture. About ten miles below the
forts the enemy had driven piling and anchored a large
raft of timber across the channel of the river, preventing
his arrival.</p>

<p>During the night our transports arrived, and at 10 a. m.
on the 15th we hauled down our colors, marched out of
the fort and embarked with the balance of the troops, and
again, under convoy of the gun boats, moved up the river
to Alexandria, arriving there about 4 p. m. on the 16th.
The enemy fell back, burning some of his quartermaster&#8217;s
stores and forage. We disembarked and went into camp
east and south of town, to await the coming of Maj. Gen.
Banks with the 13th and 19th Army Corps.</p>

<p>Alexandria was a small town of some eight hundred
inhabitants, situated at the foot of the rapids of the river.
The country around Alexandria was very rich and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span>
inhabitants very disloyal and bitter. We now had to wait
until about March 25th for the coming of Gen. Banks to
form a junction with Gen. Smith at this place. Gen.
Banks&#8217; troops were leisurely marching across the country
from the south, and upon his arrival with the 13th and
19th corps, our combined forces of all arms consisted of
about 35,000 men. Gen. Banks&#8217; men having been doing
garrison duty at New Orleans, were well clothed, and with
their new uniforms and paper collars made a very fine
appearance compared with the men of the 16th Corps, who
had been fighting and marching for the past three months
and were ragged and dirty, which condition no doubt had
much to do with influencing Gen. Banks to remark when
he saw us, &#8220;Why! I asked Gen. Sherman to send me
10,000 soldiers and he has sent me a band of ragamuffins
and guerrillas.&#8221; This is where, and how it came to pass
that we received the name which stuck to us until the
close of the war. Intended in derision by Gen. Banks, no
doubt, it soon became a pseudonym by which one of the
best divisions in the western army was ever afterwards
known, &#8220;Smith&#8217;s Guerrillas.&#8221;</p>

<p>March 26th we broke camp and marched up the river.
It was now generally known that Shrevesport was our
objective point&mdash;a strongly fortified position. March 29th
we reached and camped at a point on Red River known as
the Burr Patch. We here again embarked on transports
and under convoy of gunboats moved up the river to a
landing called Grand Ecore. At this point we disembarked
and lay in camp till the 7th of April, when we moved out
in the rear of Gen. Banks&#8217; army, which had passed this
point some two days. It seemed that we had made such
an unfavorable impression on Gen. Banks that he wished
us as much out of sight as possible and hence kept us
about a day&#8217;s march in the rear.</p>

<hr class="tb" />


<h3>Battle of Sabine Cross Roads.</h3>

<p>The 13th Corps encountered in force at Sabine Cross
Roads, on the 8th of April, Generals Kirby Smith and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span>
Taylor, commanding the enemy, who were apprised of the
fact that Gen. Banks&#8217; troops were scattered along the road
for twenty miles. Upon this knowledge they determined
to give battle outside the defenses at Shrevesport, and
chose this point, about forty-five miles southeast. The
result of the battle was a complete defeat and route of
Gen. Banks&#8217; army in detail. The night of the 8th of
April closed in with the 13th and 19th Corps in full
retreat, falling back on Pleasant Hill. The 16th Corps,
under Gen. A. J. Smith, had marched hard all day the 8th,
reaching Pleasant Hill at dark, and went into camp in
close column by regiments. We had heard Gen. Banks&#8217;
artillery all the afternoon of the 8th, and knew he was
being driven back. This meant that the men whom Gen.
Banks had called guerrillas would be in demand on the
morrow.</p>

<hr class="tb" />
<h3>Battle of Pleasant Hill.</h3>

<p>On the morning of the 9th of April Gen. Smith&#8217;s guerrillas
had no revielle. About 3 a. m. our company officers
came around nudging the sleeping men in the sides, in
commands given in whispers ordered them to fall in line,
and we were held in readiness to move. At daylight Col.
Shaw&#8217;s brigade moved out on the Mansfield road about
one mile, relieving our cavalry, who were already skirmishing.
We were posted in a strong position along the
east side of a cotton field, facing west, with a section of
the 25th N. Y. Battery. We lay in this position all the
forenoon with nothing to relieve the monotony except an
occasional shell from our artillery feeling for the enemy
in the woods beyond and frequent shots from the enemy&#8217;s
sharpshooters. About 2 p. m. the enemy opened on our
line with artillery. Our two pieces of artillery at once
limbered up and went to the rear under whip. The enemy,
thinking this was a continuation of the rout of the
day before, charged our lines with a regiment of Texas
cavalry. They, little dreaming that in the timber on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span>
other side of the field lay a line of grim veterans who had
seen service at Fort Donelson, Corinth, the Hornet&#8217;s
Nest at Shiloh, and in the trenches around Vicksburg,
made a magnificent charge to defeat and death. The enemy&#8217;s
infantry then charged and our small brigade was soon
fighting in front and flank. We held our position until
the enemy had nearly cut us off from our main line, when
we were compelled to fall back. We took a position two
hundred and fifty yards from our first stand, which we
held for over an hour and a half. Here occurred the most
desperate fighting of the day, being almost a face to face
combat. Overwhelming numbers at last forced us back to
our reserve line, after losing quite a number taken prisoners.
About sundown the final crash came when the
enemy dashed against our massed line of artillery and
infantry held in reserve. Night closed in with Smith&#8217;s
guerrillas victorious and the enemy in full retreat towards
Mansfield. The heaviest loss in the battle fell on Shaw&#8217;s
brigade, being estimated at two thirds of the whole loss
sustained in the engagement, amounting to some five
hundred men killed, wounded and taken prisoners. The
enemy&#8217;s loss was estimated at one thousand killed and
wounded, eight hundred prisoners and eleven pieces of
artillery.</p>

<p>While Smith&#8217;s guerrillas were fighting the battle of
Pleasant Hill, Gen. Banks, with the 13th and 19th Corps,
were improving the time in retreating. After caring for
our wounded by placing them in hospitals and detailing
surgeons and nurses from our ranks to care for them, about
noon of the 10th we commenced to fall back towards
Grand Ecore, following Gen. Banks&#8217; army, which had
preceded us, a shameful retreat and one that would
never have been made had Gen. A. J. Smith been commander-in-chief.
But Gen. Banks was whipped and
thoroughly incompetent to command, and seemed to only
have one idea&mdash;that was to get back to New Orleans as
quickly as possible. His men under him seemed to share
fully his demoralized condition. The 16th Corps were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span>
saucy and full of fight and had the utmost confidence in
Gen. Smith, a feeling that was mutual between the commander
and the men under him. We arrived at Grand
Ecore on the 12th, and learning that our transports and
gunboats were cooped up at Blair&#8217;s Landing, some twenty
miles up the river, with some of the transports aground
and a confederate battery below them, Gen. A. J. Smith
at once crossed the river and hurried to their relief with
the 16th Corps. After driving away the battery below and
seeing the fleet safely on their way down the river, we
returned to Grand Ecore and on the 22d of April took up
our line of retreat for Alexandria. During this time
Generals Kirby Smith and Taylor, commanding the Confederate
forces, had not been idle, but were moving troops
down the river to harass our retreat as much as possible.
On the 23d we had a lively skirmish with them at Coulterville.
Again at Monett Bluff April 23d. Here we
found the enemy posted in a strong position on the bluff
on the east side of the river. The 16th Corps was guarding
the rear; the 13th and 19th Corps failing to drive the
enemy, we were ordered up from the rear, forming on the
right of the 19th Corps, fixed bayonets and charged. The
enemy fell back and gave us for the time undisputed possession
of the right of way. It was here that Gen. A. J.
Smith informed Gen. Banks, in language more forceful
than eloquent, that he would do the fighting at either end
of the line of retreat, front or rear, but would not do both.
We resumed our march on the 24th, the 16th Corps guarding
the rear, without much trouble from the Johnnies, but
when they pushed us too closely we would form a line of
battle and they would very prudently keep at a safe distance.
In this manner we continued to retreat to Alexandria,
reaching there about April 30th.</p>

<p>The fleet had already arrived, but the water on the falls
was so low it began to look like we would have to lose
our gunboats or stay there and guard them. In the meantime,
to complicate the situation, Gen. Dick Taylor, commanding
the Confederate forces, came up with about<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span>
18,000 men. On the 2d of May the 16th Corps was busily
engaged at Henderson&#8217;s Hill skirmishing with their
advance lines. The situation was now a gloomy one
indeed, but at this critical moment Col. Bailey, of the 28th
Wisconsin, suggested that the water on the falls could be
raised by building wing dams, and as chief engineer he
was detailed to superintend this work, and the 13th and
19th Corps placed at his disposal to do the work, while
Gen. Smith, of the 16th, was drawn up in line of battle,
south and east of town, watching the enemy; skirmishing
with them May 3d at Jones&#8217; Plantation, May 4th at Bayou
LaMore, May 6th and 7th at Bayou Boeuf. Gen. Taylor
then drew off, moving down the river some twenty miles,
planting his batteries on the river bank and sinking two
of our light gunboats and capturing our mail boat and
mail.</p>

<p>About the 12th of May, the dam proving a success, the
fleet passed below the falls. On the 14th we resumed our
line of march for the mouth of Red River, Gen. Taylor
falling back in front of us. On the 16th we found him
drawn up in line of battle on the Marksville Prairie.
After three hours&#8217; fighting he fell back and took a position
on Bayou De Glaze. On the 17th, after a sharp skirmish
with him, he drew off to one side and let us pass. We then
moved on down, the 13th and 19th Corps going into camp
at Simmsport, on the Atchafalaya river, while the 16th
Corps took up a position some three miles in the rear, on
the east bank of Yellow Bayou.</p>


<hr class="tb" />
<h3>Battle of Yellow Bayou.</h3>

<p>May the 18th, 1864, the long roll called us to arms
about 12 m. Shaw&#8217;s Brigade with Battery E, 2d Mo.
Artillery, crossed the Yellow Bayou and double-quicked
about a half mile to the front and immediately became
engaged with the enemy&#8217;s advance. As fast as the several
regiments of the 16th and 17th Corps reached the field
they formed on our left. All the afternoon the tide of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span>
battle ebbed and flowed along the south bank of Bayou
Rapides. Night closed in with Gen. Taylor falling back
and Gen. Smith&#8217;s men in possession of the battle-field.
Our loss was about five hundred killed and wounded. The
enemy&#8217;s must have been much greater as they made several
determined assaults on our lines. We captured about
three hundred and fifty prisoners and from them we learned
that Gen. Taylor had about fifteen thousand men engaged,
about twice the number under Gen. Smith. About dark
on the evening of the 18th, the 13th Corps arrived on the
field and took position in front of Smith&#8217;s tired and bleeding
troops.</p>

<p>May the 19th, early in the morning, the 13th Corps
marched back to Simm&#8217;s Landing, leaving Gen. Smith with
the 16th and 17th Corps, at the front. Gen. Taylor showing
no disposition to resume hostilities and learning that
the 13th and 19th Corps were safely across the pontoons on
the Atchafalaya river, about 1 p. m. we took up our pontoon
bridge across Yellow Bayou and the 16th Corps followed
and crossed to the east bank of the Atchafalaya and
camped, just sixty-five days from the time we first camped
on the west bank on our way to Fort De Russy. On the
20th of May we reached the mouth of Red River. We
here met our transports and the portion of the 21st Mo.
that went home on veteran furlough, and embarked for
Vicksburg. The 13th Corps went south to New Orleans.</p>

<h3>Comments on the Seventy Days&#8217; Campaign.</h3>

<p>The Red River Campaign was at last, after seventy
days, at an end. It was a failure and as barren of results so
far as having any visible effects in hastening the close of
the war, as it would have been if made to the North Pole.
History records it as one of the severest campaigns of the
war. The men suffered more from hardships and privations
than any other portion of the army. Especially
was this true of the 16th Corps, which, on account of the
incompetency of Gen. Banks and his apparent dislike of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span>
the Corps, was always placed in the most exposed positions,
either in the advanced front or in the rear. It was also
unprovided with clothing and shoes and at the close of the
campaign presented a most abject appearance. Indeed
Gen. Banks might in truth have called the men, from their
appearance, &#8220;Smith&#8217;s Guerrillas.&#8221;</p>

<p>Gen. Banks&#8217; losses in the 13th and 19th Army Corps were
about three thousand men, killed, wounded and prisoners,
twenty-two pieces of artillery and one hundred and forty-five
wagons loaded with commissary stores and camp
equipments. The losses of the parts of the 16th and 17th
Army Corps present, commanded by Gen. A. J. Smith,
were about one thousand from all causes. In the several
battles and skirmishes we were engaged in we captured
from the enemy two thousand prisoners and thirty pieces
of artillery. These captures were made in battles fought
by Gen. Smith&#8217;s command, in which Gen. Banks&#8217; men
had no part. Col. Shaw&#8217;s Brigade sustained the greatest
loss of any on the expedition and it was equal to about
one-half that sustained by the whole command under Gen.
Smith.</p>


<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span>The detachment of the 21st Missouri lost about fifty
men, killed, wounded and prisoners, including one officer
of the 24th Missouri, assigned. That we did our whole
duty, I need only call attention to the fact that after the
battle of Pleasant Hill, La., Maj. Robt. Fyan, commanding
the 24th and detachment of the 21st Missouri, personally
thanked the members of the 21st for gallantry during
the action. The loss of the 24th and 21st combined during
the campaign was three officers killed, namely: Capt.
Robinson, Lieuts. Shadel and Stone, and one Color Sergeant
killed and one wounded, Wm. O&#8217;Connor of the 21st,
making a total loss of about one hundred men killed,
wounded and missing.</p>

<h3>Parting Between the 21st and 24th.</h3>

<p>We reached Vicksburg about the 21st of June and there
took leave of the 24th Missouri, and returned to our own
regiment, which had returned from its veteran furlough
north. While we were with the 24th Missouri we became
very much attached to the officers and men. The officers
were courteous and the men true comrades.</p>

<p>In writing the foregoing account of the part taken by
our brigade and regiment I have had nothing to aid me
except my memory of the events narrated, in all of which
I was an active participant. And in conclusion I now ask
the charitable consideration of comrades and the general
reader for any imperfections it may contain.</p>

<p class="drop-cap2">AT Vicksburg the detachment of the 21st taking part in
the Red River campaign joined their comrades who
had returned at the expiration of their thirty days&#8217; furlough.
On June 4th the regiment left Vicksburg on a
steamer, en route up the river for Memphis. The Confederates,
however, had erected batteries on the west bank of
the river, preventing the transports from proceeding. A
landing was made at a point called Columbia, on June 5th,
and on the following day the regiment was marched
around Lake Providence and had an engagement with the
enemy at Lake Chicot. The Confederates were completely
routed and the blockade of the river removed. On the 7th
the command re-embarked on the transports and arrived at
Memphis on the 10th without any further incident.</p>

<p>On June the 12th the regiment was ordered to the
relief of Gen. Sturgis, who had been defeated a few days
previous at Gun Town. The retreating Federals were
met at Colliersville, and under the escort of the 21st made
the trip into Memphis without being molested by the
enemy.</p>

<p>On June 25th the regiment, along with the 1st Brigade,
3d Division, to which it belonged, moved out of the city
and encamped at Moscow, on the Memphis and Charleston
Railroad, and on the 26th held Division review. On June
27th the regiment was moved to La Grange, Tenn.,
where it was encamped until July 8th. At this time it
was marched to Pontotoc, Miss., going by way of Ripley,
and traversing a distance of over one hundred miles, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span>
on the route the regiment was continuously fighting and
skirmishing with the cavalry of the enemy under Gen.
Forrest. On July 13th another move was made, to Tupelo,
Miss., a distance of twenty miles, where an engagement
with the enemy, known to history as the battle of Tupelo,
took place. The 21st took a conspicuous part in this
engagement, as will be seen by reading the report of Col.
Edwin Moore, here published:</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lieutenant</span>:&mdash;I have the honor to report the part taken
by the 21st Mo. Infantry Volunteers at the battle of Tupelo
on the 14th day of July, 1864. About 6 o&#8217;clock a. m. we
were formed in line of battle with the brigade, the 119th
Illinois Infantry Volunteers being on our left and the 58th
Illinois Infantry on our right. About 7:30 a. m. the enemy
opened on us with artillery, which continued until 9
o&#8217;clock a. m., when they advanced their infantry in line
of battle, driving in our skirmishers precipitately.
They came within twenty paces of our line when I gave
the order to fire and immediately after to advance. The
fire was well directed and took the enemy by surprise, who
fled in great disorder, with the regiment in pursuit, and
for fifteen or twenty minutes a continuous and deadly fire
was poured in upon them; its effect was visible on the
field. There being no enemy in sight after advancing
four hundred and fifty yards, we returned to our former
position and were not again attacked during the day,
although frequently subjected to a heavy artillery fire.
The officers and men of the command behaved with the
utmost gallantry, obeying every order with that promptness
which secures success. Our loss was one man killed
and fifteen wounded.</p>

<p class="right">
<span class="smcap">Edwin Moore</span>,<br />
Lieut.-Col. 21st Mo. Inf. Vols., Com.</p></blockquote>

<p>On the day following the Tupelo fight the command
was ordered back to Memphis. On the same day, while
encamped for dinner, we were attacked by the Confederates<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span>
who were, however, repulsed after a lively skirmish, and
the men resumed their meal. This time they were
allowed to eat in peace and to finally reach Memphis without
any further brushes with the enemy. On August 5th
the regiment was sent on another excursion in pursuit of
the Confederate General Forrest, who was reported to be
rendezvousing in the vicinity of Memphis. On the Talahatchie
river they first encountered the enemy, when a
lively skirmish took place. This was on August 9th.
The next brush with the Confederates occurred on the 12th,
and again at Hurricane Creek on the 13th. Oxford, a
distance of one hundred and fifty miles from Memphis, was
reached August 22d. Here, after meeting and repulsing
the enemy, startling news was received from Memphis, by
courier, to the effect that Forrest had captured and was in
possession of the city. There was an immediate call to
arms and in double quick time the command was hurried
on the journey back to recapture the city. They arrived,
however, to find that the Confederate leader had been in
the city but had taken his departure.</p>

<p>On September 5th, 1864, the regiment embarked on the
steamer W. R. Wallace for Cairo, Ill. They were confined
on board transports at Cairo when orders were received to
proceed to St. Louis to assist in repelling the invasion of
Missouri by the Confederates under Gen. Price. On
arriving at St. Louis the regiment was moved down the
Iron Mountain R. R., to De Sota, to intercept Gen. Price,
who was reported at or near Pilot Knob. Gen. Price
failed to show up at that point but was reported moving
in the direction of Jefferson City. On learning this fact
the command was hastily put on cars and returned to Jefferson
Barracks, near St. Louis. Then commenced the
long, weary march after Price, through Central Missouri,
going by way of Franklin, Jefferson City, Sedalia, Lexington
and Independence. The command came up with
the rear guard of the enemy at Little Blue, about three
miles west of Independence, on October 23d. Here, after
skirmishing, they were routed. Gen. Price being harassed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span>
by Federal troops, both front and rear, commenced
retreating out of the State, the infantry following him
south to Harrisonville, where the chase was abandoned by
the infantry, the cavalry following him on into Arkansas.
The infantry returned towards St. Louis, marching by
way of Pleasant Hill, Lexington and Glasgow, where they
crossed over to the north side of the Missouri river;
resuming the march from the river, by way of Fayette,
Columbia, Warrenton, High Hill and St. Charles, where
the command crossed back to the south side of the Missouri
river, marching to and arriving in St. Louis on the
23d of November. On this pursuit after Gen. Price the
division, with which was the 21st Missouri, made a forced
march of fifty-six miles, which was the longest continued
march known in military history.</p>

<p>On the trip back to St. Louis the command was being
continually annoyed by Quantrell&#8217;s and Anderson&#8217;s guerrillas,
and lost several men killed by these outlaws.</p>

<p>Gen. A. J. Smith, commanding the 16th Army Corps,
having received orders to report to Gen. George H.
Thomas at Nashville, Tenn., the 21st Missouri embarked
on board the steamer Mars en route for Nashville, where
they arrived on the 30th of November. Leaving the
steamer, the 21st was moved out two miles southwest of
the city and threw up breastworks to assist in repelling the
attack of the Confederate General Hood, which was
hourly expected. Hood appeared on December the 1st
and began a regular siege of Nashville, which continued
until the 15th of December, when Gen. Thomas moved
out of his intrenchments, hurling the 16th Corps, which
held the position on his right, against Hood&#8217;s left. The
enemy was driven back, doubling his left flank back on
his center, capturing a number of prisoners and several
pieces of artillery. The night of the 15th closed in with
Hood&#8217;s crushed and bleeding army driven back to a strongly
fortified position in the Brentwood Hills, some three
miles from the position he held in the morning. The
battle was resumed early on the morning of the 16th, with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span>
varying results until 3 p. m., when Gen. Thomas, seeing
the decisive moment had come, ordered a general assault,
and Hood&#8217;s broken and reeling columns were sent whirling
down the pikes in the direction of Columbia, Tenn.
Thus ended the vain boast of President Davis, at Macon,
made to the Tennessee troops after the capture of Atlanta
by Sherman: &#8220;Tennesseeans, be of good cheer; you will
soon see the green fields of Kentucky.&#8221; The remnant of
the proud army that had dealt Gen. Sherman so many
crushing blows was hurrying to make its escape across the
Tennessee river&mdash;to escape complete annihilation.</p>

<p>On the morning of the 17th of December, 1864, the 16th
Corps, under Gen. A. J. Smith, was ordered in pursuit of
Gen. Hood&#8217;s fleeing army. The pursuing army followed
to Clifton, by way of Pulaski, and arrived at Clifton on
the 2d of January. Here they embarked on board transports
en route for Eastport, Miss., where they arrived on
the 7th of January, 1865, and went into camp, remaining
in camp and performing usual routine duty until February
9th, when they embarked on transports for New Orleans,
where they landed on February 21st. They remained in
New Orleans in camp until March 22d, when they took
steamer and were carried, by way of Lake Pontchartrain
and the Gulf, to Dauphin Island, at the foot of Mobile
Bay, where they camped, arriving on the 24th. A few
days afterwards another move was made to Spanish Fort,
near Mobile, <i>via</i> Fish river and a land march. The Fort
was invested and captured on April 8th. On the 3d of
April the division, in which was the 21st regiment, began
operations against Fort Blakely, taking part in the many
skirmishes in the approach and siege of that important
Confederate stronghold, and in its final capture on April
9th. In the charge on the fortifications on the 9th, the
21st had two color bearers killed and was the first regiment
to plant its flag on the ramparts. In the charge the
loss of the regiment was heavy, about equal to that of the
whole brigade.</p>

<p>We had at Blakely the rumor of Lee&#8217;s surrender, during<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span>
the afternoon of the charge and capture of the fort. The
bugle sounded the charge at 6 o&#8217;clock p. m. and in seven
and one-half minutes the fort surrendered. This was the
last battle of the war. The Federal loss was two thousand
killed and wounded. We captured thirty-two cannon and
four thousand prisoners. Thus the 21st Missouri was
engaged in the last battle of the war as well as in one of
the first.</p>

<p>On April 13th the 21st Regiment marched with the 16th
Corps to Montgomery, Alabama, arriving on the 27th and
going into camp two miles northeast of the city. Here
they remained in camp until June 1st, when they were
taken, with the brigade, to Providence Landing, on the
Alabama River, reaching there June 4th, and embarked
on a steamer the same day for Mobile. On the arrival of
the regiment at Mobile they went into camp in the suburbs.
Here they remained, doing outpost and other guard
duty until March, when they were ordered to Fort Morgan
for duty, and on April 19th, 1866, were mustered out.</p>

<p>This was the last day of the organization known as the
21st Missouri Infantry Volunteers. After their long and
arduous labors in defence of their country came the soldiers&#8217;
reward&mdash;an honorable discharge from the service
and then the going home to family and loved ones. But
there was many a long drawn sigh, for who among the
survivors of this heroic band failed to recall some gallant
comrade, who, full of pride and patriotic ambition, left
the Missouri home never to return. On this battle field
and that one their bodies lay buried; a soldier&#8217;s grave,
unmarked and unidentified; a family of expectant loved
ones, in fond old Missouri, waiting and watching in vain.
But this was war, the cruel war now over.</p>

<p>Camp was broken on the 19th of April, 1866, and with
their discharges the men took their departure for their
Missouri homes.</p>

States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting

agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work

phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and

  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the

License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
